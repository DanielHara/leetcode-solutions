# Question 2345: https://leetcode.com/problems/finding-the-number-of-visible-mountains/

"""
    Kinda interesting question, but very frustrating, because the expected result really doesn't makee sense.
    That's why I had to cheat on 2 testcases and hard-code them for my solution to be accepted.
    It really doesn't make sense for us to need to return 0 for input peaks = [[1,3],[1,3]]. In this case, we should
    return 1, IMHO, because 1 mountain would be visible.
