# Leetcode-solutions

Having cracked 800+ questions on Leetcode (check out my profile on https://leetcode.com/haradaniel/), trying to aim for 1 question a day since 2019, I'll start to publish my solutions here too!

The inspiration for solving one question everyday came from the great book Atomic Habits: https://www.amazon.com/Atomic-Habits-Proven-Build-Break/dp/0735211299

And remember: maybe in 2 years React, Python, Java or whatever you're working with will not be around any longer, but you'll always have to master algorithms!
