# Leetcode-solutions

After having cracked quite a few questions on Leetcode (check out my profile on https://leetcode.com/haradaniel/), trying to aim for 1 question a day since 2019, I started to publish my solutions here too!

The inspiration for solving one question everyday came from the great book Atomic Habits: https://www.amazon.com/Atomic-Habits-Proven-Build-Break/dp/0735211299

And remember: maybe in 2 years React, Python, Java or whatever you're working with may not be around any longer, but you'll always have to master algorithms!

## How I approach the questions

I'm trying to keep up to the rhythm of one question every day. I mostly solve Medium question, as they are about just the right difficult level to keep a consistent pace over a long period of time. I did attempt quite an amount of Hard ones, as well, some of which I find really hard until today. I normally just pick a random Medium question and start grinding. Some of them are frustrating and kinda useless, but some are brilliant, very interesting problems!

I never look at the solutions, really. If I cannot solve a question after some time, I just leave it. I add it to my To-Do list, if it looks like an interesting question, and try again later. There were plenty of questions to which I returned after some time, like a month, and was able to solve after giving myself a break.

Sometimes I do look at the hints, though. Always as little as possible, and, if so, I peek just at the first hint, and look at the other ones only if I'm still stuck.

After consistently doing this for 5+ years, I've now solved 1000+ questions. That's a LOT. I'm aiming to write a post on Medium about what I learned in this process, and I'll link here.
